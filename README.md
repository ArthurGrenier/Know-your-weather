A long time ago, I realised that weather sites were far too complicated. Too much information, given on quarter days, inaccurate...  
For someone like me who cycles several hours a day this is a problem as I never know when I might get rained on and how much.  
So I decided to create this little application that allows you to have a clear weather forecast per hour with precision.
