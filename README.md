A long time ago, I realised that weather sites were far too complicated. Too much information, given on quarter days, inaccurate, often with a lot of advertising, ...  
For someone like me who cycles several hours a day this is a problem as I never know when I might get rained on and how much. There is also a second, parallel reason. A few years ago, I started to take an interest in plants and vegetables. It became clear to me that the weather plays a very important role in their development. So I added some new features for people who want to take care of their garden. Like warning about frost, drought, and so on...  
So I decided to create this little application that allows you to have a clear weather forecast per hour with precision.
